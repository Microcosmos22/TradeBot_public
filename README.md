# TradeBot — Learning Market Dynamics from Synthetic Correlations
Simulating trading behavior and training neural networks on synthetic financial data.

This project shows that a neural network can learn meaningful market patterns
that stem from commonly used pre-programmed bots on the real market.
It also permits using this network in an own, real-time trading bot,
and includes different tools for getting, analyzing and pre-processing data.
It is meant to make this whole process more easy!

The main result states:

## 🧠 Project Overview

1. Load historical BTCUSDT data  
2. Compute technical indicators and prepare model inputs  
3. Diagnose data distributions and correlations  
4. Generate synthetic market data with controlled structure  
5. Train neural network on real vs synthetic data  
6. Simulate a trading bot using trained model  

First install with:
